## About
This project contains code to optimise a PID motor controller using a deep Q network based reinforcement learning implementation. The program can tune PID controllers for any angle and configuration of K_p, K_i, and K_d values with the objective of eliminating overshoot and minimizing time.

## How we did it

The PID controller is coded in Python 2.7 and uses the Roboclaw library to control the motor and receive feedback. The reinforcement learning part is coded in Python 3.6 on the PyTorch framework. 

The agent is defined as the K values that need to optimised to get the optimal overshoot and time values. 

The state varuables are defined to be the overshoot and settling time of the motor.

Actions generated by the neural network either increase or decrease the K values unitl they finally converge on the optimal values.
